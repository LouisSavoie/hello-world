# hello-world
My first Repository.

My name is Louis Savoie, nice to meet you.

I'm learning OOP with Java using MOOC.fi from the University of Helsinki. My friend, who is a programmer himself, got me into this. I've always been a maker, so he suggested I give coding a try. I think I fell in love, oops. 

I've just completed a project he gave me, which was to GET data for videos from the YouTube API and use it to create a subreddit post using the Reddit API. It was a lot of fun learning all the new things I needed to get the job done. I learned about cURL, REST APIs, JavaScript, Node.js, 2 different wrappers, and tried a new IDE (I've only use NetBeans previously), Visual Studio Code.

I'm really looking forward to building more stuff. I've been making little CLI games in Java inbetween my lessons, which I enjoy doing. Reinforcing things like using notes, encapsulation, inheritance, and otherwise keeping my code neat and not like spaghetti. The YouTubeToRedditBot, so aptly named, was the first of my projects to actually do something outside of the IDE. That was a brilliant moment.

After all that, my friend said to check out GitHub and learn Git. Here I am :D

Thank you for reading my introduction, have a great day, and I'll see you in future Repositories!

-Louis
